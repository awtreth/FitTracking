# FitTracking

Project 3 of course CS528-S16 (Mobile and Obiquitous Computing) at WPI

Basically it detects your activity (STILL, WALKING, RUNNING or IN_VEHICLE) and show your state in the screen;
Display a GoogleMaps view indicating your current position;
Play a song when you are running;

This app can be useful for studying purposes.
For example, it may be good to learn how to use some Google Services such as Activity Recognition, Location and Google Maps
